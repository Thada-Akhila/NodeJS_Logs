# 🚀 High Performance Logs API

## 📌 Overview

A **production-grade logging system** designed to handle **high-volume concurrent requests** using Node.js.

This project simulates real-world backend systems where multiple services generate logs simultaneously, and focuses on **scalability, performance, and system design concepts**.

# 🎯 Key Features

* High-throughput log ingestion API
* Redis-based queue system
* Background worker for batch processing
* MongoDB storage with pagination
* Load testing for performance analysis
* Advanced rate limiting strategies

# 🏗 System Architecture

## 🔹 Initial Approach

```
Client → API → MongoDB (1 request = 1 write)
```

Problem:

* High database load
* Poor scalability

---

## 🔹 Optimized Architecture

```
Client
  ↓
API Server
  ↓
Redis Queue
  ↓
Background Worker
  ↓
Batch Insert → MongoDB
```

---

# ⚡ Performance Optimization

### Before:

```
10,000 requests → 10,000 DB writes
```

### After:

```
10,000 requests → ~100 batch inserts
```

---

# 🧪 Load Testing

Custom script used to simulate thousands of concurrent requests.

### Observations:

* High CPU usage during load
* Database bottleneck in naive approach
* Improved performance with batching

---

# 🛡 Rate Limiting Evolution

## Day 5 – Basic Rate Limiting

* Used express-rate-limit
* In-memory limiting
* Not scalable

---

## Day 6 – Redis Rate Limiting

* Distributed rate limiting
* Atomic counters using Redis
* Works across multiple servers

---

## Day 7 – Sliding Window Rate Limiter (Final)

* Uses Redis Sorted Sets
* Tracks request timestamps
* Prevents burst traffic
* Production-grade solution

* maintain performance under stress

It reflects **practical backend engineering and system design thinking**.


## 🚀 Day 8 – Redis Caching & Performance Optimization

### 🔥 Features Added

* Implemented **Redis caching (Cache-Aside pattern)**
* Reduced database load significantly
* Designed **unique cache keys for pagination & filtering**
* Implemented **efficient cache invalidation using Redis SET**
* Avoided blocking Redis operations like `KEYS`

---

### ⚡ Caching Flow

1. Client requests logs
2. Server checks Redis cache
3. If cache HIT → return instantly ⚡
4. If cache MISS → fetch from DB 🐢
5. Store response in Redis
6. Track cache key for invalidation

---

### 🧠 Cache Invalidation Strategy

* All cache keys stored in:

  ```
  logs_cache_keys (Redis SET)
  ```
* On new log insertion:

  * Fetch all keys
  * Delete them
  * Clear tracking set

---

### 📈 Performance Impact

* Faster API responses
* Reduced MongoDB load
* Scalable caching mechanism

---

### 🏗️ Updated Architecture

Client → API → Rate Limiter → Redis Cache → MongoDB
↓
Redis Queue → Worker → DB

---

### 💬 

> Designed a scalable caching layer using Redis with efficient cache invalidation, improving system performance and ensuring data consistency.
